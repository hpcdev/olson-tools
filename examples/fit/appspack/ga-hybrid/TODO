1.  Implement a cache manager interface for the ga.  This should be a template
    parameter so that we can easily use the APPSPACK cache manager.   

2.  Get the multiple instances of APPSPACK sharing cache manager, or at least
    merging cached results.  
DONE

3.  Code up a wrapper of the appspack::[P]ExecMinFunc class for the ga.  It has
    to be a wrapper class because the ga maximizes merit instead of trying to
    minimize a function.  
MOSTLY DONE

4.  Make the Merit functions as executed directly by the GA run in parallel as
    much as possible.
