# Examples for APPSPACK extensions

echo These are examples for extentions of Sandia National Labs' APPSPACK
     optimization software. ; 
echo You will obviously need to have appspack to use these. ;
echo This Jamfile expects appspack to have its own Jamroot properly configured
     to do the right thing at ../../../appspack ;
echo ;
echo If you want to try the PIPE-IO version, you will need to also have
     pstreams similarly configured at ../../../pstreams ;
