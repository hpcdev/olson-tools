Testing instructions for libtrapfe$(EXT).a:

1.  do 'make' and you will get a program that does cause a floating point
exception.  The problem is that gcc, by default, disables the trapping of
these floating point exceptions.

2.  do 'make TRAPFE=1' and you will still get a bad program that doesn't trap
the exceptions.

2.  do 'make DEBUG=-g TRAPFE=1' and you will get a program that not only causes a
floating point error, but also traps it.  The program will emit an error and
go into an infinite loop, waiting for you to investigate its cause.


These DEBUG= and TRAPFE= make flags are are available and automatically
applied to all code that uses my olson-tools Makeconf.  By 'uses', I mean that
you Makefile must not only include it, but also use the CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LIBS,
etc when compiling.
