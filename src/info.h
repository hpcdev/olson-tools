/** \mainpage A simple manual

    The OlsonTools package includes a variety of routines and algorithms that
    I've developed and collected over the past few years.  This collection
    represents tools that are most useful for scientific and numerical
    software.

/** \page random Random Routines
    There are several routines for generating random numbers of various
    distributions.  The base generator for most of these is the \ref MTRand
    MerserneTwister package from Richard Wagner.

    This document is a work in progress.

    Make sure you have first read \ref intro "the introduction".
