1.  Make another rk example for using impulse forces.  Perhaps I could use the
    optical force simulation as an example(?).


2.  Perhaps document this in the field-lookup file:
    These do not NEED to be converted to cylindrical coords, but can be sped up by
    a factor of 2 doing so.
        inline double scalar_lookup(r, i);
        inline void vector_lookup(retval, r, i);

        DONE

3.  Figure out where to put unit-tests and how to get them compiled any time
    that a file changes.
